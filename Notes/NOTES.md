---------------TO-DO----------------
1) fix what happens after everyone has eaten 

- lock and unlock everytime you you print a message
- mutex locks part of the function that no other threads can use it
- one philo get's one fork so he dies thats oke
- if trying to change variable, do i use it elsewhere? then mutexlock it.

-------------------REMINDER---------------------------
- ./philo 1(number of philo) 2(time_to_die) 3(time_to_eat) 4(time_to_sleep) 5(times_eaten)
